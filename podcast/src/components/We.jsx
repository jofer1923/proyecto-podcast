          Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
          have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this
          point of pale light.

        <p>
          Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In
          our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will
          come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
